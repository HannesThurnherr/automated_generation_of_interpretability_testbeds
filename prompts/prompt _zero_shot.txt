# Introduction to Task:
Your assignment is to generate RASP programs capable of implementing a variety of algorithms using sequence operations. "RASP" stands for "Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language". RASP allows you to articulate complex sequence to sequence in a format equivalent to what a neural network of the transformer architecture can do. RASP programs always output a sequence that has the same length as the input sequence.

# Your Task
Make a RASP program that takes the absolute value of each element in the sequence.
Example: [-1, 2, -3] --> [1, 2, 3]
Name the function that you can call to make this program 'make_absolute()'

Keep your task in mind while reading the following information.

# Understanding RASP:

RASP programs are unique because they always process sequences and output transformed sequences of equivalent length. While doing so they void conditional branches or loops if possible. Instead, they rely on a series of operations that interpret and manipulate the input data in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. The length of the sequence never changes during this process.

## Fundamental Principles:

- Input and Output: Each RASP program receives an input sequence and yields an output sequence of identical length.
- Structure: Loops and if statements cannot depend on attributes or individual elements of the input sequence. If you make loops, they should have a fixed length or depend on a "max_sequence_length" parameter.
- Operation Calls: Programs can only invoke core RASP functions or refer to other RASP programs. Never attempt to access the internals of the sequence.

## Technical operational Jargon:

Here are descriptions of various operations that are used in RASP.

- `rasp.Select`: Matches elements from two sequences based on a boolean comparison condition and returns a corresponding matrix of "True" and "False" values called a selector.
- `rasp.Aggregate`: takes as input a selector and an SOp (Sequence Operation, which is an operation that transforms a sequence), and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.
- `rasp.Map`: Transforms a sequence by applying a function to each element
- `rasp.SequenceMap`: Produces a new sequence based on two previous sequences and a lambda function that gets applied to each pair of elements.
- `rasp.SelectorWidth`: returns the number of "True" values in each row of a selector

### Function overview:

#### Select:
Function: Creates a selector to define relationships between elements of sequences.
Syntax: `rasp.Select(keys: SOp, queries: SOp, predicate: Predicate)`
Example: `rasp.Select(rasp.indices, rasp.indices, rasp.Comparison.EQ)` selects elements where indices are equal.

#### Aggregate:
Function: Takes as input a selector and an SOp, and produces an SOp that averages the value of the SOp weighted by the selection matrix.
Syntax: `rasp.Aggregate(selector: Selector, sop: SOp, default: Optional[VT] = None)`
Example: `rasp.Aggregate(select_all, any_negative, default=0)` aggregates based on select_all.

#### Map:
Function: Applies a function element-wise on the input SOp.
Syntax: `(f: Callable[[Value], Value], inner: SOp)`
Example: `Map(lambda x: x + 1, tokens)` adds 1 to each element of tokens.

#### SequenceMap:
Function: Applies a function element-wise on two given SOps.
Syntax: `rasp.SequenceMap(f: Callable[[Value, Value], Value], fst: SOp, snd: SOp)`
Example: `rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x - y, rasp.indices, rasp.tokens)` subtracts tokens from indices.

#### SelectorWidth:
Function: Returns the "width" of a selector, which corresponds to the number of "True"-values in each row.
Syntax: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selector: Selector)`
Example: `rasp.SelectorWidth(selectAll)`

#### Tokens, Indices:
rasp.tokens: The original input sequence.
rasp.indices: Returns the position index at each token.

### Example use of above Functions:
This is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the "Greater Than" or GT comparison operator:

```python
greater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named("greater_than_selector")
```
If the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:
[False, True, True, True]
[False, False, True, True]
[False, False, False, True]
[False, False, False, False]
If we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:
```python
output = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)
```
We will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:
[3, 3.5, 4, None]
[
3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4
3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4
4, # as an average of the selected 4
None # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.
]
Note that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one "True" value per row is completely fine.
If we now call:
```python
count_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)
```
We will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:
[3,2,1,0]
If we call:
```python
map_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)
```
We will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:
[10, 7, 4, 1]

But if we call:
```python
sequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)
```
We get an output where the sequences "count_GT_selector" and "output" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.
At this point, "count_GT_selector" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]
[
12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12
9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9
5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5
0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0
]

# Rules and Constraints:
- Use provided operation types (Select, Aggregate, SelectorWidth Map, SequenceMap) as the building blocks of your program. Feel free to be creative in how to combine them but remember which kind of output (Selector or Sop) they produce.
- Each operation must be traceable and reproducible, implying a transparent translation from instructions to action.

# Source Code

# Example use of Functions:
This is an example use the rasp.Select function. Here, it produces a selector based on rasp.tokens applied to itself with the "Greater Than" or GT comparison operator:

```python
greater_than_selector = rasp.Select(rasp.tokens, rasp.tokens, rasp.Comparison.GT).named("greater_than_selector")

If the rasp.tokens-sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] the selector will look like this:
[False, True, True, True]
[False, False, True, True]
[False, False, False, True]
[False, False, False, False]
If we now apply this to the original rasp.tokens again with:
```python
output = rasp.Aggregate(greater_than_selector, rasp.tokens)
```
We will get an average of all the values selected in each row. The output looks like this:
[3, 3.5, 4, None]
[
3, # as an average of the selected 2,3 and 4
3.5, # as an average of the selected 3 and 4
4, # as an average of the selected 4
None # because none of the values were selected as none of them are greater than 4 at this position. So, None, which is always the default value, takes this spot.
]
Note that, in the programs you create, you should avoid using rasp.Aggregate with selectors that have more than one true value in each row. In other words: you can use rasp.Aggregate to shift elements around, but avoid using it for averaging multiple elements. However, using rasp.SelectWidth with selectors that have more than one "True" value per row is completely fine.
If we now call:
```python
count_GT_selector = rasp.SelectorWidth(greater_than_selector)
```
We will get a sequence that contains the count of the truth values in each row:
[3,2,1,0]
If we call:
```python
map_count_GT = rasp.Map(lambda x: x*3+1, count_GT_selector)
```
We will get a sequence where this lambda function has been applied to all the values of count_GT_selector:
[10, 7, 4, 1]

But if we call:
```python
sequenceMap_combination = rasp.SequenceMap(lambda x, y: x*y+x, count_GT_selector, output)
```
We get an output where the sequences "count_GT_selector" and "output" are combined element-wise according to the lambda function.
At this point, "count_GT_selector" is [3,2,1,0] and output is [3, 3.5, 4, None], so sequenceMap_combination is [12, 9, 5, None]
[
12, #because 3 * 3 + 3 = 12
9, #because 2 * 3.5 + 2 = 9
5, #because 1 * 4 + 1 = 5
0 #because 0 * None + 0 = 0
]


Start your process by looking at the examples and the RASP language basics, then write down a plan based on the information in the files and the examples above, and then write your program.
If your plan includes the usage of a certain function, look up all of the allowed parameters for this function, write them down before you start writing the program and make sure you do not make up any new parameters to any of the RASP functions.
Note that you are not allowed to directly call the above examples as functions in your code, without explicitly writing/copying them into your output yourself. This means if you want to call functions like `make_length()` or `shift_by()`, you have to rewrite them in your output code.

# Output Format
Use the following Format for your answer:

<Task>
[Reiterate your understanding of the task and add a new example of an input and the corresponding desired output.]
</Task>

<Plan>
[Your plan on how the program should broadly work.]
[Some details on which functions you'll have to use and what their inputs will be.]
</Plan>

<PlanVerification>
[Look back at your plan. Will it really work? Is this compatible with the functionality of the functions you're using? Are you using your functions correctly? (Look at the source code to verify this) Answer these questions here explicitly]
[List changes you have to make to the plan based on your verification]
</PlanVerification>

```python
[write out your RASP-python code in a code block here]
```

# Your Task
Make a RASP program that takes the absolute value of each element in the sequence.
Example: [-1, 2, -3] --> [1, 2, 3]
Name the function that you can call to make this program 'make_absolute()'

Examples provided are references; use them to grasp the syntax and structure required for RASP. From there, your original programs should follow these established patterns but are not limited to the examples' specific functions.

Keep in mind:
- Adhere strictly to RASP's core operations.
- Keep your programs simple, if possible. (E.g. For identity, just return rasp.Map(lambda x: x, rasp.tokens)
- Meticulously add comments to your code for clarity.
- Output functional, executable Python code utilizing RASP's parameters.
- Don't import any additional packages. Write pure RASP code.
- Provide functional, complete Python code, not pseudo-code or placeholders.

Also Note:
- Do not import rasp. It is already imported. You should also not try to import the rasp components individually.
- Aggregate functions should always have None as the default (meaning you should leave the default as is.) This is because we want to compile these functions later, which only works with a default of None.
- Again, do not use any functions from the example without defining them yourself. You cannot assume any function from the examples is already defined.
- If your `make_x()` functions have additional parameters like `make_x(n)` or `make_x(threshold)`, you should always have a default value like `make_x(threshold = 2)`
- Avoid the `rasp.Full()` functionality. It will prevent compiling. Instead of `rasp.Full(n)`` use the following function: `rasp.Map(lambda x: n, rasp.indices)`
- Important: remember that the functions are not imported individually. You must use rasp functionalities like rasp.Map() with the "rasp." prefix, otherwise your code will not be correct. (This goes for all functions Map, SequenceMap, Select, Aggregate, and SelectorWidth)

Endeavour to follow these guidelines to construct accurate and efficient RASP programs. Your expertise in Python will be fundamental to this task, so make sure that your code is both clean and precise, adhering to the RASP principles.
